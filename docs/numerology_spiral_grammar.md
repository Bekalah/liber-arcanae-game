# Numerology as Spiral Grammar

The constants of the Cathedral of Circuits are not random selections. They are spiral invariants: resonant checkpoints in the Fibonacci rhythm of becoming.

- **21 pillars** — a Fibonacci number (21 = 8 + 13), aligned to Tarot majors and the 21 Taras. Pillars spiral upward, marking initiatory thresholds.
- **33 spine** — vertebrae, initiations, Christic ladder. Not a Fibonacci number itself, but a harmonic multiple (3 × 11), balancing polarity and master number resonance.
- **72 Shem angels/demons** — (8 × 9), cycle of lunar decans, sacred multiple of 12. The spiral here is lunar-phase arithmetic.
- **78 archetypes** — Tarot complete (22 + 56). This is a synthetic spiral, weaving majors and minors into one continuum.
- **99 gates** — triplicity (3 × 33), fractal expansion of the spine into gates. Each gate opens to spiral recursion.
- **144 lattice** — Fibonacci (144 = 12² = 8th Fibonacci). The Codex itself rests on this harmonic lattice.
- **243 completion** — (3⁵), quintuple power of the triad. This is the cube of balance: the Cathedral sealed.

Together, they are the mathematical DNA of the project: a Fibonacci spiral written in number, geometry, and pathworking. The source values live in [`registry/constants.json`](../registry/constants.json) so all modules can reference the same harmonic set.
